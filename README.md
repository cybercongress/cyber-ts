## Usage
### RPC Clients

```js
import { cyber } from '@cybercongress/cyber-ts';

const { createRPCQueryClient } = cyber.ClientFactory; 
const client = await createRPCQueryClient({ rpcEndpoint: RPC_ENDPOINT });

// now you can query the cosmos modules
const balance = await client.cosmos.bank.v1beta1
    .allBalances({ address: 'cyber1addresshere' });

// you can also query the cyber modules
const balances = await client.cyber.exchange.v1beta1
    .exchangeBalances()
```

### Composing Messages

Import the `cyber` object from `@cybercongress/cyber-ts`. 

```js
import { cyber } from '@cybercongress/cyber-ts';

const {
    createSpotLimitOrder,
    createSpotMarketOrder,
    deposit
} = cyber.exchange.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;
```

#### CosmWasm Messages

```js
import { cosmwasm } from "@cybercongress/cyber-ts";

const {
    clearAdmin,
    executeContract,
    instantiateContract,
    migrateContract,
    storeCode,
    updateAdmin
} = cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;
```

#### IBC Messages

```js
import { ibc } from '@cybercongress/cyber-ts';

const {
    transfer
} = ibc.applications.transfer.v1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl
```

#### Cosmos Messages

```js
import { cosmos } from '@cybercongress/cyber-ts';

const {
    fundCommunityPool,
    setWithdrawAddress,
    withdrawDelegatorReward,
    withdrawValidatorCommission
} = cosmos.distribution.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;

const {
    multiSend,
    send
} = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;

const {
    beginRedelegate,
    createValidator,
    delegate,
    editValidator,
    undelegate
} = cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;

const {
    deposit,
    submitProposal,
    vote,
    voteWeighted
} = cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;
```

## Connecting with Wallets and Signing Messages

⚡️ For web interfaces, we recommend using [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit). Continue below to see how to manually construct signers and clients.

Here are the docs on [creating signers](https://docs.cosmology.zone/cosmos-kit) in cosmos-kit that can be used with Keplr and other wallets.

### Initializing the Stargate Client

Use `getSigningCyberClient` to get your `SigningStargateClient`, with the proto/amino messages full-loaded. No need to manually add amino types, just require and initialize the client:

```js
import { getSigningCyberClient } from 'cyber-ts';

const stargateClient = await getSigningCyberClient({
  rpcEndpoint,
  signer // OfflineSigner
});
```
### Creating Signers

To broadcast messages, you can create signers with a variety of options:

* [cosmos-kit](https://docs.cosmology.zone/cosmos-kit) (recommended)
* [keplr](https://docs.keplr.app/api/cosmjs.html)
* [cosmjs](https://gist.github.com/webmaster128/8444d42a7eceeda2544c8a59fbd7e1d9)
### Amino Signer

Likely you'll want to use the Amino, so unless you need proto, you should use this one:

```js
import { getOfflineSignerAmino as getOfflineSigner } from 'cosmjs-utils';
```
### Proto Signer

```js
import { getOfflineSignerProto as getOfflineSigner } from 'cosmjs-utils';
```

WARNING: NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE PLAIN-TEXT MNEMONICS. Please take care of your security and use best practices such as AES encryption and/or methods from 12factor applications.

```js
import { chains } from 'chain-registry';

const mnemonic =
  'unfold client turtle either pilot stock floor glow toward bullet car science';
  const chain = chains.find(({ chain_name }) => chain_name === 'cyber');
  const signer = await getOfflineSigner({
    mnemonic,
    chain
  });
```
### Broadcasting Messages

Now that you have your `stargateClient`, you can broadcast messages:

```js
const { send } = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;

const msg = send({
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'coin',
        amount: '1000'
    }
    ],
    toAddress: address,
    fromAddress: address
});

const fee: StdFee = {
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'coin',
        amount: '864'
    }
    ],
    gas: '86364'
};
const response = await stargateClient.signAndBroadcast(address, [msg], fee);
```

## Advanced Usage


If you want to manually construct a stargate client

```js
import { OfflineSigner, GeneratedType, Registry } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing";
import { AminoTypes, SigningStargateClient } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

import { 
    cosmosAminoConverters,
    cosmosProtoRegistry,
    cosmwasmAminoConverters,
    cosmwasmProtoRegistry,
    ibcProtoRegistry,
    ibcAminoConverters,
    cyberAminoConverters,
    cyberProtoRegistry
} from 'cyber-ts';

const signer: OfflineSigner = /* create your signer (see above)  */
const rpcEndpint = 'https://rpc.cosmos.directory/cyber'; // or another URL

const protoRegistry: ReadonlyArray<[string, GeneratedType]> = [
    ...cosmosProtoRegistry,
    ...cosmwasmProtoRegistry,
    ...ibcProtoRegistry,
    ...cyberProtoRegistry
];

const aminoConverters = {
    ...cosmosAminoConverters,
    ...cosmwasmAminoConverters,
    ...ibcAminoConverters,
    ...cyberAminoConverters
};

const registry = new Registry(protoRegistry);
const aminoTypes = new AminoTypes(aminoConverters);

const stargateClient = await SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner(rpcEndpoint, signer, {
    registry,
    aminoTypes
});
```

## Developing

When first cloning the repo:

```
yarn
yarn build
```

### Codegen

Look inside of `scripts/codegen.ts` and configure the settings for bundling your SDK and contracts into `@cybercongress/cyber-ts`:

```
yarn codegen
```

### Publishing

To publish, use `lerna`:

```
lerna publish
```

You can publish patch, minor, or major versions:

```
lerna publish minor
```

If you absolutely need to publish manually using npm, ensure to do it this way, and publish from the `dist/` directory for proper tree-shaking module paths:

```
cd ./packages/<your-telescope-module>
yarn build
cd dist
npm publish
```
